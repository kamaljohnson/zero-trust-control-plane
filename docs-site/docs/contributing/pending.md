# Pending documentation

This file lists documentation entries that are planned but not yet written for the project. Each entry is a suggested topic with a short description.

## To be written

All previously listed items have been documented or removed from scope. Frontend architecture, gRPC API overview, deployment and operations, and organization and membership are now documented. Policy engine and session lifecycle were already documented. CLI and Contributing were removed from the pending list.
