  "description": "This document describes device-trust logic in the zero-trust control plane backend: how devices are identifiable, revocable, and time-bound; policy evaluation (OPA/Rego) that decides when MFA is required and when to register or refresh trust; and configuration. For MFA flows (Login MFA branch, Refresh MFA branch, VerifyMFA, challenge/OTP, API), see mfa.md. Business logic lives in internal/identity/service/authservice.go; policy evaluation is in internal/policy/engine/.",
