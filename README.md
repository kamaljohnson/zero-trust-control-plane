# Zero-Trust Control Plane (PoC)

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/kamaljohnson/zero-trust-control-plane/graph/badge.svg?token=T0A6M30PG0)](https://codecov.io/gh/kamaljohnson/zero-trust-control-plane)

A proof-of-concept **zero-trust session and policy control plane** designed to demonstrate continuous authorization, centralized policy enforcement, **action-level telemetry and auditability**, and real-time session revocation across multiple client types.

This project focuses on the **control-plane architecture** behind enterprise security systems (such as enterprise browsers and secure access platforms), rather than client-side enforcement or UI complexity.

---

## What this project demonstrates

- A **zero-trust access model** where every client action is explicitly authorized
- **Centralized session management** with heartbeat validation and instant revocation
- **Org admin dashboard** (web): members, audit log, policy config (five sections), and telemetry link; session revocation invalidates tokens and logs out revoked sessions
- **Centralized policy configuration** per org (Auth & MFA, Device Trust, Session Management, Access Control, Action Restrictions) with sync to org MFA settings
- **Policy-driven authorization** evaluated statelessly on the backend
- **Multi-tenant isolation** across users, devices, sessions, policies, and telemetry
- **Structured telemetry and audit trails** for authorization decisions and session events
- **Backend-first design**, treating all clients as untrusted

---

## What this project is *not*

- Not a full enterprise browser implementation  
- Not a hardened endpoint security solution  
- Not a production-ready compliance platform  

Security guarantees are modeled logically to validate system design, observability, and control-plane semantics.

---

## High-level architecture

- **Backend (Go):** Stateless gRPC control plane: authentication (optional; requires DB and JWT keys), session management, policy evaluation, telemetry, and audit. Auth and database are enabled only when configured; see [backend/README.md](backend/README.md).  
- **Web Client (Next.js):** Thin, session-aware client that requests actions and reflects backend authorization decisions  

All authorization decisions and audit events are generated by the backend; clients only request actions and react to outcomes.

---

## Repository structure

- **backend/** — Go gRPC API server and optional worker; authentication, session management, policy, telemetry, audit (including login/logout and session events). See [backend/README.md](backend/README.md). Auth and database are optional (enabled when `DATABASE_URL` and both JWT keys are set); see the [Docusaurus docs site](#documentation) for details.
- **frontend/** — Next.js web client; session-aware, reflects backend authorization. See [frontend/README.md](frontend/README.md).

## Documentation

**All documentation is available in the Docusaurus docs site** located in the `docs-site/` directory. This is the primary and most comprehensive source of documentation for the project.

### Accessing the Documentation

To view the documentation locally:

```bash
cd docs-site
npm install
npm run start
```

The docs site will be available at http://localhost:3001 (default port). The frontend "Docs" button links to this site; set `NEXT_PUBLIC_DOCS_URL` in your frontend environment (e.g. `http://localhost:3001` in development).

### What's Covered

The Docusaurus site includes comprehensive documentation on:
- **Backend**: Authentication, sessions, session lifecycle, org policy configuration, policy engine, database schema and migrations, telemetry, audit logging, device trust, MFA, health checks, and testing
- **Frontend**: Architecture, dashboard (org admin), and user browser
- **Operations**: Deployment guides
- **Contributing**: Guidelines and pending work

### Quick Reference

- **[backend/README.md](backend/README.md)** — Backend layout, configuration, code generation, and run instructions.
- **[frontend/README.md](frontend/README.md)** — Web client setup and run.

## Intended audience

This project is intended as:
- A **systems design and architecture demonstration**
- A **senior backend / platform engineering portfolio**
- A reference for **zero-trust, policy enforcement, and auditability concepts**
