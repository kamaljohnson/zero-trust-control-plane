# Zero-Trust Control Plane (PoC)

A proof-of-concept **zero-trust session and policy control plane** designed to demonstrate continuous authorization, centralized policy enforcement, **action-level telemetry and auditability**, and real-time session revocation across multiple client types.

This project focuses on the **control-plane architecture** behind enterprise security systems (such as enterprise browsers and secure access platforms), rather than client-side enforcement or UI complexity.

---

## What this project demonstrates

- A **zero-trust access model** where every client action is explicitly authorized
- **Centralized session management** with heartbeat validation and instant revocation
- **Policy-driven authorization** evaluated statelessly on the backend
- **Multi-tenant isolation** across users, devices, sessions, policies, and telemetry
- **Structured telemetry and audit trails** for authorization decisions and session events
- **Client-agnostic enforcement**, supporting both a web client and a CLI
- **Backend-first design**, treating all clients as untrusted

---

## What this project is *not*

- Not a full enterprise browser implementation  
- Not a hardened endpoint security solution  
- Not a production-ready compliance platform  

Security guarantees are modeled logically to validate system design, observability, and control-plane semantics.

---

## High-level architecture

- **Backend (Go):** Stateless gRPC control plane: authentication (optional; requires DB and JWT keys), session management, policy evaluation, telemetry, and audit. Auth and database are enabled only when configured; see [backend/README.md](backend/README.md).  
- **Web Client (Next.js):** Thin, session-aware client that requests actions and reflects backend authorization decisions  
- **CLI Client (Go):** Policy-controlled command-line client demonstrating continuous authorization, auditability, and real-time revocation  

All authorization decisions and audit events are generated by the backend; clients only request actions and react to outcomes.

## Repository structure

- **backend/** — Go gRPC API server and optional worker; authentication, session management, policy, telemetry, audit (including login/logout and session events). See [backend/README.md](backend/README.md). Auth and database are optional (enabled when `DATABASE_URL` and both JWT keys are set); details in [backend/docs/auth.md](backend/docs/auth.md) and [backend/docs/database.md](backend/docs/database.md).
- **frontend/** — Next.js web client; session-aware, reflects backend authorization. See [frontend/README.md](frontend/README.md).
- **cli/** — Go CLI client; policy-controlled, continuous authorization and auditability.

## Intended audience

This project is intended as:
- A **systems design and architecture demonstration**
- A **senior backend / platform engineering portfolio**
- A reference for **zero-trust, policy enforcement, and auditability concepts**
